# Packed stream readers for the concrete macro-scalar certificate tree

Physical layout (all values are natural-number literals):

* topology: `20` three-bit tokens per `60`-bit word, exactly as the audited
  `packedTopologyStream`; `0` = terminal, `1..5` = split on axis `0..4`.
* leaves: one `321`-bit word per terminal in DFS order:
  - bit `0`: kind (`0` = affine tail, `1` = quadratic);
  - bits `1..80`: five `16`-bit dyadic-`16384` relative anchor codes;
  - bits `81..320`: fifteen `16`-bit term codes
    (`0..55` stable envelope piece, `32768+n` scalar certificate `n`, `65535` zero model);
  - tail words are exactly `0`.
  Leaf words are packed `leafBlockSize` per block word, least significant first.

Soundness of the replay never depends on how the streams are read; physical canonicality
(exact sizes, ranges, zero padding) is checked separately in `Macro/Layout.lean`.
