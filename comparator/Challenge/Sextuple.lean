Challenge/Sextuple.lean — TRUSTED comparator challenge module for the
sextuple (six-translate) improvement of the simple critical-line proportion.

The coefficient `0.6727556` (and the tighter `0.672755620655`) is strictly
below the exact endpoint `(6·B_MT − 10π·B₆)/(6 − A₆) = 0.67275562065609…`
with `A₆ = 1/80`, `B₆ = 1094977/5000000000`, and strictly above the
Montgomery--Taylor endpoint `0.6725007036…`.  `N0simple` counts simple
on-line zeros; the denominator `Ncount` counts all zeros with multiplicity.
Proof: Solution.Sextuple.  Config: comparator/config-sextuple.json.

The four `sorry`s are deliberate (challenge side).

The definitions below are inlined character-for-character from comparator/ChallengeDeps.lean
(the trusted Mathlib-only definition layer, which continues to exist for the Solution build), so
that this module's ONLY import is Mathlib. The anonymous `section` scopes ChallengeDeps.lean's
`open`s to the inlined definitions, leaving the elaboration context of the statements below exactly
as it was when this module imported the definition layer. The comparator identifies constants by
name and requires each definition to elaborate identically to its Solution-side namesake. The block
is the COMPLETE definition layer, not just the constants these statements mention: elaborating the
layer as a whole is what keeps the auxiliary lemmas it generates (e.g. N0star._proof_1, which later
definitions reuse) named identically on the challenge and solution sides.

/-! ## 1. Nontrivial zeros of ζ and the counting functions (Theorems A–D) -/

/-- ρ is a nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function: ζ(ρ) = 0 with 0 < Re ρ < 1 (the open
critical strip). Every zero in the strip is "nontrivial" in the usual sense (it is neither a trivial
zero −2(n+1), of real part ≤ −2, nor the pole s = 1); the converse — that every zero other than the
trivial ones lies in the open strip — is classical and is not needed to state the theorems. -/

/-- m_ρ, the multiplicity of ρ: the order of vanishing of ζ at ρ, via Mathlib's `analyticOrderAt`
(ℕ∞-valued; `toNat` sends ⊤ to 0, so `1 ≤ zeroMult ρ` encodes both "ζ is not locally identically
zero at ρ" and "ρ is a zero"). -/

(`∑ᶠ` is Mathlib's finite sum; that the window contains finitely many zeros is proved on the
solution side, not assumed). -/

/-! ## 3. The Montgomery–Taylor constant of Theorem D -/

/-- c₁* := √2·tan ϑ / (1 + ϑ·tan ϑ) at ϑ = 1/√2 — the paper's closed form for the optimal-window
constant c*_λ = √2·tan ϑ/(1 + ϑ·tan ϑ), ϑ = λ/√2, at λ = 1. Numerically c₁* = 0.7532960…
(= 2·tan(1/√2)/(√2 + tan(1/√2)); 1/c₁* = 1/2 + 2^{-1/2}·cot(2^{-1/2}) is the Montgomery–Taylor
constant). Theorem D's proportions here are 2 − 1/c₁* = 0.67250… (for N₀* and N₀ˢ) and
(3 − 1/c₁*)/2 = 0.83625… (for N_d); the decimals are NOT part of the formal statements. -/
